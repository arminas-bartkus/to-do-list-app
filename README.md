# to-do-list
An Odin Project creating a To-do List App featuring an extensive feature set

This project aims to use good coding practices,
an expansion on webpack, and practicing the ideas,
I have learnt so far in the JS Course.

This project will mainly focus on:

- Using and configuring webpack
- Composition Vs Inheritance (using composition)
- Further practice on creating modules and
loosely coupling objects
- Using and manipulation .json files
- Further practice on constructor classes
or factory functions (in this case, I have
chosen to use constructor classes)
- Including the date-fns library
- Applying the SOLID Principles:

1. Single responsibility
2. Open-closed
3. Liskov substitution
4. Interface segregation
5. Dependency inversion

In doing so I aim to produce a well developed
and rich featured to do list app with the
following functionality/criteria:

- To Do List should have a default list/project
and ability to add additional lists
- Should have task-priority switching with colour coding
- Should have a completion bar with each project
- Subheadings within projects
- A task Title, desc, due date, priority level,
additional notes, checklist feature, and countdown
to completion
- Search Bar to search through notes
- Sort by priority/date feature
- "In progress" feature
- Crossed out "done" section
- Should access the Web Storage API to save
local storage
