If subheadings are the same, task deletion and creation is duplicated, fix?

// error thrown if you edit a task and dont input a date

// error thrown if project title is nothing when made and tried to load

// weird errors with editing tasks, investigate

// make editable date min value "today"

// if tasks repeat titles then edits are done to all clones. dont allow user to do this.

// make the functions methods for each indivi task, subheading, project  etc.
