If subheadings are the same, task deletion and creation is duplicated, fix?

// if there are 2 projects and task 2 gets edited then it will edit task 2 on both

// if tasks repeat titles then edits are done to all clones. dont allow user to do this.

// only allow unique project, subheading, task names
