If subheadings are the same, task deletion and creation is duplicated, fix?

// error thrown if you edit a task and dont input a date

// if there are 2 projects and task 2 gets edited then it will edit task 2 on both

// weird errors with editing tasks, investigate

// make editable date min value "today"

// if tasks repeat titles then edits are done to all clones. dont allow user to do this.

// make the functions methods for each indivi task, subheading, project  etc.
